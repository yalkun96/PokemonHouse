# Pokelib üß¨

Pokelib is a Django-based web application that displays Pok√©mon data using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Users can view random Pok√©mon on the homepage, filter Pok√©mon by type, or search by name. Each Pok√©mon has a detailed page showing species, types, abilities, forms, and (if available) evolution chains.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Only ~130 out of 1300 Pok√©mon have full evolution chain data loaded due to partial API fetching.
